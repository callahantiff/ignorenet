# Knowledge-Driven Mechanistic Enrichment of the Preeclampsia Ignorome
## What is an Ignorome?
The ignorome has been defined as the portion of a gene signature shown to be significantly associated with a specific disease, but without a published mechanistic link — and often without any published disease association. Recently, researchers seeking to answer questions like “what proportion of genes with intense and selective expression in specific tissues, cells, or systems are still almost completely uncharacterized with respect to biological function?”<sup>1</sup> and “In what ways do these functionally enigmatic genes differ from well-studied genes?”<sup>1</sup> discovered that in general, the top 5% of statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were responsible for 70% of the published literature for a given disease<sup>1</sup>. Examining ignored genes in more detail, these researchers found that there were no differences between the published and ignored genes in terms of their connectivity in co-expression networks; the biggest factor as to whether or not a gene was well-represented in the literature was its date of discovery<sup>1</sup>.
